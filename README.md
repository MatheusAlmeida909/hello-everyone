# hello-everyone
Hi! I'm starting my github repositories and here's what i'm thinking

  I'll be learning C++ as a main programming language, mainly because is very flexible as to where to use and i'm not 100% sure where to go.
My first steps will be trying to develop small aplications such as calculators, simple games and much more to develop my knowledge on both 
language and logic.
  
  If you stumble across this github please leave a sugestion or comment whatever you think would be a <b>good idea<b> ðŸ˜„
